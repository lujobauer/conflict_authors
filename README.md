Python script to warn of discrepancies between conflicts in DBLP and HotCRP.

This script needs to be run from the server that runs HotCRP. It only performs 
read operations to the HotCRP database.

You need to edit config.py with the password/login/database name information. 
You can get these variables from the HotCRP configuration files.
